## Projects

- **knn/** — K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm  
  Includes a Jupyter notebook and Python script for classification on the Iris dataset.

- **svm/** — Support Vector Machine algorithm  
  Implementation and experiments with SVM on example datasets.

## Structure

Each project folder contains:

- `*.ipynb` — Jupyter notebooks with explanations and visualizations  
- `*.py` — Python scripts for model training and evaluation  
- `data/` — Dataset files used by the project  
- `images/` — Plots and figures generated  
- `results/` — Output files such as metrics or model checkpoints  
- `README.md` — Project-specific documentation
